# The Data
The dataset is made using a combination of the Datagolf archieve API (datagolf.com) as well as the Visual Weather Crossing API (visualcrossing.com)

The dataset used includes every PGA golfer's individual stats in every PGA golf tournament played since June 2nd, 2019 that offered betting odds (only excludes 2 tournaments). This means we will be able to analyze over 200 different golf tournaments, and tens of thousands of 3-Ball bets.
